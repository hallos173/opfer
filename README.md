  [Discord] - SelfBot is a Script Gathering for Windows, Linux, MacOS systems written in Python.
</p>
This SelfBot has a large number of commands to make your life on discord easier. It has a nice and intuitive interface to make it easy to use for everyone, help and explanations for each command, a very complete help command.
Given the attractiveness of this SelfBot, which is one of the latest functional ones, I made sure to update it as soon as possible.
I've intentionally removed a large proportion of the initial commands deemed unnecessary. However, if any of the old commands seem worth adding, please create an issue or contact me on discord.
I'll try to keep this repo up to date in the future.
